I always struggled to talk about the stuff I've been doing. Seriously, having to
keep selling myself is one of the things I hate most about working in tech.

Do I really need to act like my stupid "CRUD" is the Pinnacle of engineering?
It's not.

## Creating a Blog

As much as I dislike “selling myself,” I still need a place to talk about what
I’ve been doing, something better than just dropping updates in some random group
chat with friends.

You can't just disappear and expect that the world will care about you later.

I considered using LinkeIn, but people there expect you to be ~~fake~~ overly
professional. I also thought about doing YouTube videos, but that's way too much work.

In the end, I picked the good old Blog. And here we are.

I'll probably still share most of my posts on LinkedIn too, I don't expect a crowd
of people checking this blog every day waiting for the next post.

But at least here I can still be **me**, you know?
